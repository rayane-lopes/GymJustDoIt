## 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Project

# 📜 Introduction
This project is a personal initiative to explore programming concepts and create a gym workout management system. It includes various features and functionalities that I thought would be useful in such a system.

# ✒️ Functionalities
- With this program, you can register your student in the system and make a specific workout for them.
- So that you don't get disoriented with so many possible exercises to put together a workout, I've organized the workout into “UpperBody”, “LowerBody” and “Cardiorespiratory”. This way, you can better divide up your exercises.

# 🧐 Details and curisioties
- My gym has nomead like Just Do It because I believe that very things should be just start and after fix or better it.
- In this repository you'll find some ideas that I had without any teacher or college. So I ask apologyze for some errors or desorganizations in my code. 
- I'm learning and this project I decided to risk in to do a program just only with ideias of my brain. 
- Thanks for reading!
